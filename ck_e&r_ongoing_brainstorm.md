## CODE KITTY RETENTION/ENGAGEMENT

* "missions" --> individual challenge that maps real-world obstacles/tasks to falsifiable "success" moment --> and (but not necessarily!) one version of code that provides it.

* stack overflow style points system: spend point to 'challenge' other person; gain 2 points (and they gain 5) if they complete it

* monthly raffle: new "missions" selected to get an illustration (posted on digital repo, and creator gets copy of illustration)

* Users post different code solutions at challenges, and image/comic/video of your code kitty solving the challenge -- encourage naming code kitty -- create code kitty name generator a la Code Kitty 1V7.40q ("Pasteur")

* user creation needs to be done w/ chance token (_until you can generate enough invested users to keep internet dickery grassroots-modded -- remember Secret Hitler talk_)
